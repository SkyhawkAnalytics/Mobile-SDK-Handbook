# Mobile SDK Handbook

This handbook provides a high level overview of the different components that make up the SDK, so that developers can get a feel for the SDK's structure and its different components. This handbook does not aim to provide specific information that can be found in the SDK. After reading through this handbook, developers should be able to begin working closely with the SDK.
